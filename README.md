##Create A Portfolio to use later on

In this challenge we were able to set up a simple personal Portfolio using our own HTML Semantic Elements and HTML Syntax. Aside from creating an html from scratch we also has to create our own CSS stylesheet using Advanced CSS elements such as pseudo classes and elements, box styling, CSS Selectors and Variables. 



##HTML

In the HTML I created a lot of classes as i found that to be the most effective way to target them and stykle them in the CSS. Although I did use a lot of divs, I will refracture my code later on as i better understn how to not use as many divs tags. I added some comments in my HTML to explain my thought process. I worked on my HTML mainly in my VS Code I added comments to explain my reasons, for my repository I copied and pasted my code from my VS Code.



##CSS

AS previously explained in the HTML i used a lot of divs tags for my different class elements as that is how i found the targeting of the intented elements more effective in CSS. As i go over previous lessons i will try to go back and refractore the code to try and make it more simple.

##Tests

I composed my HTML and CSS code in VS Code and my first step was to find the best structure for my HTML. I took some examples from our previous Module 01 Challenge to see the structure for my HTML as well as some previous examples in our previous class lessons. After setting up a very basic HTML format i started to target headers, sections, and other elements in the CSS to play around with some styling. I then started to add more HTML semantic elements to my HTML to better specify them in the CSS. I also used the "inspect" option when browing my website in chrome to add different properties, styles, and values to my css without changing my code in VS Code. I then found that added classes to target more specific elements in CSS was for me the most effective way. I added classes in the HTML while testing in the live browser that it was not changing the format of my website but instead the styling. 

##Resources 

###Classes

One of the resources i used was locally, I went back a lot to our previous lessons and also revisiting some of the zoom recordings from our class to get some explanation from our instructore.

###Website 1

One of the websites that has the most useful information was https://www.w3schools.com/ . The website offer the ability to also try codes and run them for practice as well as some clear examples.

###Website 2

Another source I found very helpful was https://stackoverflow.com/ . I found this source to be helpful as it helped relate to real people with the same or similar problems. One of the best features was the people explaining their thought process and their reason and explanation to the solution.

##Wbsite 3

For 100% of my pictures I was able to use came from https://stock.adobe.com/ . I did some research on where to find certain specific pictures to input in thr HTML and https://stock.adobe.com/ offered several options.
