# My-Portfolio-GM

##Create A Portfolio to use later on
In this challenge we were able to set up a simple personal Portfolio using our own HTML Semantic Elements and HTML Syntax. Aside from creating an html from scratch we also has to create our own CSS stylesheet using Advanced CSS elements such as pseudo classes and elements, box styling, CSS Selectors and Variables. 



##HTML
In the HTML I created a lot of classes as i found that to be the most effective way to target them and stykle them in the CSS. Although I did use a lot of divs, I will refracture my code later on as i better understn how to not use as many divs tags. I added some comments in my HTML to explain my thought process. I worked on my HTML mainly in my VS Code I added comments to explain my reasons, for my repository I copied and pasted my code from my VS Code.



##CSS
AS previously explained in the HTML i used a lot of divs tags for my different class elements as that is how i found the targeting of the intented elements more effective in CSS. As i go over previous lessons i will try to go back and refractore the code to try and make it more simple.

##Tests
I composed my HTML and CSS code in VS Code and my first step was to find the best structure for my HTML. I took some examples from our previous Module 01 Challenge to see the structure for my HTML as well as some previous examples in our previous class lessons. After setting up a very basic HTML format i started to target headers, sections, and other elements in the CSS to play around with some styling. I then started to add more HTML semantic elements to my HTML to better specify them in the CSS. I also used the "inspect" option when browing my website in chrome to add different properties, styles, and values to my css without changing my code in VS Code. I then found that added classes to target more specific elements in CSS was for me the most effective way. I added classes in the HTML while testing in the live browser that it was not changing the format of my website but instead the styling.
